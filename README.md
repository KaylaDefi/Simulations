# Simulations
This respository is composed of my HTML and JavaScript studies. 
I am currently learning to code considering time and space in order to simulate movement.
There are many possibilities when it comes to virtual simulations and I plan to post some of my code here as I explore.
For any questions, comments, or concerns, I can be contacted at k.r.s13@outlook.com
